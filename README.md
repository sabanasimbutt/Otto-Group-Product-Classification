* Used `GridSearchCV` to make the process of finding the best hyperparameters of model simpler (though it's computationally expensive)
* Calibration of predicted probabilities of model using `CalibratedClassifierCV`


**Evaluation metric:** multi-class logarithmic loss; **Scored:** 0.47640 (Top 30%)
